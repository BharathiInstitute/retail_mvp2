# Retail ERP MVP â€“ Flutter Shell

Modular, scalable Flutter 3.x app shell with Riverpod, GoRouter, Material 3, and Firebase placeholders.

## Tech stack

## Modules

## Structure
```
lib/
	app.dart                # MaterialApp.router + themes
	core/
		router/app_router.dart
		widgets/app_shell.dart, common_widgets.dart
		state/app_state.dart
		(features now self-contained; legacy models/services removed)
		(guards removed; role guard example now inline-commented in app_router.dart)
	features/
		<feature>/{ui,models,services}
```

## Firebase

Ensure Firebase is initialized via `firebase_options.dart` (generated by FlutterFire). The app initializes Firebase in `main.dart` using `DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform`.

### Firestore

- Rules file: `firestore.rules`
- To deploy rules (optional CLI step):

  1) Install Firebase CLI and login
  2) Initialize hosting if not already (optional)
  3) Deploy only rules

  See commands in the section below.

### Optional: Deploy Firestore rules via CLI

Prerequisites: Firebase CLI installed and authenticated; project set to `retail-erp-dc742`.

Commands (PowerShell):

```powershell
firebase use retail-erp-dc742
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## Run
1) Install deps
2) Run on any device/web

Notes: Firebase is not initialized. Mock providers make the UI render without backend. Replace mocks gradually with real services.
